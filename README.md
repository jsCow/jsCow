## Getting Started
This grunt plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

Go into your project directory and install Grunt + all required plugins.
Execute the following commands in your shell:

```shell
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-clean grunt-contrib-less grunt-contrib-copy grunt-contrib-compress grunt-contrib-uglify grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```shell
cls && grunt
```
